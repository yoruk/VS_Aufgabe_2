 * @mainpage libcaf
 *
 * @section Intro Introduction
 *
 * This library provides an implementation of the actor model for C++.
 * It uses a network transparent messaging system to ease development
 * of both concurrent and distributed software.
 *
 * `libcaf` uses a thread pool to schedule actors by default.
 * A scheduled actor should not call blocking functions.
 * Individual actors can be spawned (created) with a special flag to run in
 * an own thread if one needs to make use of blocking APIs.
 *
 * Writing applications in `libcaf` requires a minimum of gluecode and
 * each context <i>is</i> an actor. Even main is implicitly
 * converted to an actor if needed.
 *
 * @section GettingStarted Getting Started
 *
 * To build `libcaf,` you need `GCC >= 4.7 or <tt>Clang >=
 *3.2</tt>,
 * and `CMake`.
 *
 * The usual build steps on Linux and Mac OS X are:
 *
 *- `mkdir build
 *- `cd build
 *- `cmake ..
 *- `make
 *- `make install (as root, optionally)
 *
 * Please run the unit tests as well to verify that `libcaf`
 * works properly.
 *
 *- `./bin/unit_tests
 *
 * Please submit a bug report that includes (a) your compiler version,
 * (b) your OS, and (c) the output of the unit tests if an error occurs.
 *
 * Windows is not supported yet, because MVSC++ doesn't implement the
 * C++11 features needed to compile `libcaf`.
 *
 * Please read the <b>Manual</b> for an introduction to `libcaf`.
 * It is available online as HTML at
 * http://neverlord.github.com/libcaf/manual/index.html or as PDF at
 * http://neverlord.github.com/libcaf/manual/manual.pdf
 *
 * @section IntroHelloWorld Hello World Example
 *
 * @include hello_world.cpp
 *
 * @section IntroMoreExamples More Examples
 *
 * The {@link math_actor.cpp Math Actor Example} shows the usage
 * of {@link receive_loop} and {@link caf::arg_match arg_match}.
 * The {@link dining_philosophers.cpp Dining Philosophers Example}
 * introduces event-based actors and includes a lot of `libcaf
 * features.
 *
 * @namespace caf
 * Root namespace of libcaf.
 *
 * @namespace caf::mixin
 * Contains mixin classes implementing several actor traits.
 *
 * @namespace caf::exit_reason
 * Contains all predefined exit reasons.
 *
 * @namespace caf::policy
 * Contains policies encapsulating characteristics or algorithms.
 *
 * @namespace caf::io
 * Contains all network-related classes and functions.
 *
 * @defgroup MessageHandling Message handling.
 *
 * This is the beating heart of `libcaf`. Actor programming is
 * all about message handling.
 *
 * A message in `libcaf` is a n-tuple of values (with size >= 1)
 * You can use almost every type in a messages - as long as it is announced,
 * i.e., known by the type system of `libcaf`.
 *
 * @defgroup BlockingAPI Blocking API.
 *
 * Blocking functions to receive messages.
 *
 * The blocking API of libcaf is intended to be used for migrating
 * previously threaded applications. When writing new code, you should use
 * ibcafs nonblocking become/unbecome API.
 *
 * @section Send Send messages
 *
 * The function `send` can be used to send a message to an actor.
 * The first argument is the receiver of the message followed by any number
 * of values:
 *
 * @code
 * // spawn some actors
 * auto a1 = spawn(...);
 * auto a2 = spawn(...);
 * auto a3 = spawn(...);
 *
 * // send a message to a1
 * send(a1, atom("hello"), "hello a1!");
 *
 * // send a message to a1, a2, and a3
 * auto msg = make_message(atom("compute"), 1, 2, 3);
 * send(a1, msg);
 * send(a2, msg);
 * send(a3, msg);
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section Receive Receive messages
 *
 * The function `receive` takes a `behavior` as argument. The behavior
 * is a list of { pattern >> callback } rules.
 *
 * @code
 * receive
 * (
 *   on(atom("hello"), arg_match) >> [](const std::string& msg)
 *   {
 *     cout << "received hello message: " << msg << endl;
 *   },
 *   on(atom("compute"), arg_match) >> [](int i0, int i1, int i2)
 *   {
 *     // send our result back to the sender of this messages
 *     return make_message(atom("result"), i0 + i1 + i2);
 *   }
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * Please read the manual for further details about pattern matching.
 *
 * @section Atoms Atoms
 *
 * Atoms are a nice way to add semantic informations to a message.
 * Assuming an actor wants to provide a "math sevice" for integers. It
 * could provide operations such as addition, subtraction, etc.
 * This operations all have two operands. Thus, the actor does not know
 * what operation the sender of a message wanted by receiving just two integers.
 *
 * Example actor:
 * @code
 * void math_actor() {
 *   receive_loop (
 *     on(atom("plus"), arg_match) >> [](int a, int b) {
 *       return make_message(atom("result"), a + b);
 *     },
 *     on(atom("minus"), arg_match) >> [](int a, int b) {
 *       return make_message(atom("result"), a - b);
 *     }
 *   );
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section ReceiveLoops Receive loops
 *
 * Previous examples using `receive` create behaviors on-the-fly.
 * This is inefficient in a loop since the argument passed to receive
 * is created in each iteration again. It's possible to store the behavior
 * in a variable and pass that variable to receive. This fixes the issue
 * of re-creation each iteration but rips apart definition and usage.
 *
 * There are four convenience functions implementing receive loops to
 * declare behavior where it belongs without unnecessary
 * copies: `receive_loop,` `receive_while,` `receive_for` and `do_receive`.
 *
 * `receive_loop` is analogous to `receive` and loops "forever" (until the
 * actor finishes execution).
 *
 * `receive_while` creates a functor evaluating a lambda expression.
 * The loop continues until the given lambda returns `false`. A simple example:
 *
 * @code
 * // receive two integers
 * vector<int> received_values;
 * receive_while([&]() { return received_values.size() < 2; }) (
 *   on<int>() >> [](int value) {
 *     received_values.push_back(value);
 *   }
 * );
 * // ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * `receive_for` is a simple ranged-based loop:
 *
 * @code
 * std::vector<int> vec {1, 2, 3, 4};
 * auto i = vec.begin();
 * receive_for(i, vec.end()) (
 *   on(atom("get")) >> [&]() -> message { return {atom("result"), *i}; }
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * `do_receive` returns a functor providing the function `until` that
 * takes a lambda expression. The loop continues until the given lambda
 * returns true. Example:
 *
 * @code
 * // receive ints until zero was received
 * vector<int> received_values;
 * do_receive (
 *   on<int>() >> [](int value) {
 *     received_values.push_back(value);
 *   }
 * )
 * .until([&]() { return received_values.back() == 0 });
 * // ...
 * @endcode
 *
 * @section FutureSend Send delayed messages
 *
 * The function `delayed_send` provides a simple way to delay a message.
 * This is particularly useful for recurring events, e.g., periodical polling.
 * Usage example:
 *
 * @code
 * delayed_send(self, std::chrono::seconds(1), atom("poll"));
 * receive_loop (
 *   // ...
 *   on(atom("poll")) >> [] {
 *     // ... poll something ...
 *     // and do it again after 1sec
 *     delayed_send(self, std::chrono::seconds(1), atom("poll"));
 *   }
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * See also the {@link dancing_kirby.cpp dancing kirby example}.
 *
 * @defgroup ImplicitConversion Implicit type conversions.
 *
 * The message passing of `libcaf` prohibits pointers in messages because
 * it enforces network transparent messaging.
 * Unfortunately, string literals in `C++` have the type `const char*,
 * resp. `const char[]. Since `libcaf` is a user-friendly library,
 * it silently converts string literals and C-strings to `std::string` objects.
 * It also converts unicode literals to the corresponding STL container.
 *
 * A few examples:
 * @code
 * // sends an std::string containing "hello actor!" to itself
 * send(self, "hello actor!");
 *
 * const char* cstring = "cstring";
 * // sends an std::string containing "cstring" to itself
 * send(self, cstring);
 *
 * // sends an std::u16string containing the UTF16 string "hello unicode world!"
 * send(self, u"hello unicode world!");
 *
 * // x has the type caf::tuple<std::string, std::string>
 * auto x = make_message("hello", "tuple");
 *
 * receive (
 *   // equal to: on(std::string("hello actor!"))
 *   on("hello actor!") >> [] { }
 * );
 * @endcode
 *
 * @defgroup ActorCreation Actor creation.

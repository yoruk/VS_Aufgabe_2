/**
 * Implements scheduling of actors via work stealing. This implementation uses
 * two queues: a synchronized queue accessible by other threads and an internal
 * queue. Access to the synchronized queue is minimized.
 * The reasoning behind this design decision is that it
 * has been shown that stealing actually is very rare for most workloads [1].
 * Hence, implementations should focus on the performance in
 * the non-stealing case. For this reason, each worker has an exposed
 * job queue that can be accessed by the central scheduler instance as
 * well as other workers, but it also has a private job list it is
 * currently working on. To account for the load balancing aspect, each
 * worker makes sure that at least one job is left in its exposed queue
 * to allow other workers to steal it.
